        <div>
          <title></title>
          <p class="main-text">In HTML and CSS there are lots of <span class="unknown-word"> selectors</span>. Selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once and element has been targeted,
            we could apply a style or set of styles.<br>
          Today we are going to talk about two selectors: <span class="unknown-word">Class</span> and <span class="unknown-word">ID</span>.<br>
          The ID selector allows us to define style rules that apply to a single element on the webpage. Each webpage can only have one element with a single ID attribute. 
          This means the ID selector can never be used to style more than one element.
          The Class selector can be used as many times as we want within the same webpage. So, If we have a series of common properties to apply to different elements, it would be 
          appropriate to use class.<br>
          In the next example I am going to show you the difference between them.
          </p>
          <img src="../images/ClassID.jpg" alt="Id and Class in HTML" class="image-techblog">
          <p class="main-text">The first image shows you that we applied a class in two paragraphs. That is why we want to have the same background color in both paragraphs.</p>
          <img src="../images/CSSidclass.jpg" alt="Class and ID CSS definition" class="image-techblog">
          <p class="main-text">Te second image shows you the id. We are going to apply a specific design for this paragraph, and it is going to be use in only this one, because its going 
            to be a resume of the paragraphs above it.<br>
            <br>
            This was a brief, very brief explanation. I will add more information on the subject shortly.
