      <p class="main-text">The fisrt situation that come up of my mind now was like 6 years ago. When I decided to leave my country, city, family, friends...
        I had to take a decision, I was tired of "live to work". 
        Now , while I am typing this, I am thinking that maybe in that moment the values that I tought I had, I did not put them in practice or 
        I just did not act through them.
        I think my values are family, friendship, kindness and IDK the correct word for it, but I would say I like to help people.
        I guess coming from a Latinamerican country, we give a lot of importance to the family.
        
        One fo my strengths is that I am persistent, perfectionist...It is hard to think about it. Limitation right now is my language, at least I am thinking on that. I think people do not have limitations, we/they put them there. Maybe I am wrong.
        
        I am thinking about the experience, but the only thing poppin from my mind is trying to improve the business that I was working on. But it was very hard to do it, especcialy when you work
        with people who think diffrently. I tried different ways to explain my position but they did not work.
        I do not know what strategies I would use in the future, I have to think and reflect about it.
