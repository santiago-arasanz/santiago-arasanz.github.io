          <h2 class="titles">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to core learning?</h2>

          <p class="main-text">I learnt that it is harder than I though to express myself. I found that it is very hard to me
          ask for help, I do not know why, but it is hard. I think that it is something that I have to work on.<br> 
          I found myself frustrated sometimes, specially when I cannot solve a task or piece of code, but during the last 
          weeks I tried to ask more and share ideas with people and it was much more productive.<br>
          The last one but not less important is that sometimes I lose interest when I do not see a clear horizon or objective.
          I guess sometimes I get stuck in the small picture and I cannot focus to continue.<br><br>

          <h2 class="titles">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>

          <p class="main-text">I think all of them are going to help you to integrate groups and interact with people.
          Specially programming, because it is something that it is constantly evolving. Then it could be a richer
          experience if whe share with people.<br><br>

          <h2 class="titles">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>

          <p class="main-text">It surprised me that actually you can improve yourself, learn or change
          ways to resolve tasks or deal with problems.<br><br>

          <h2 class="titles">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>

          <p class="main-text">I think the most challenging aspect is start to implement it.
          Because I thought it was a waste of time, but when you realize that you are gaining skills, evolving your thoughts 
          It becomes a very important part of your process.<br><br>

      <div class="container">
          <h2 class="titles">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing
          on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
          </h2>

          <p class="main-text">I think it is realted with the industry. It is a career that involves a lot of human skills.
          Because you are not working alone, you will work with a lot of people, and you are going to interact with them every day. 
          It is the key stone to have a great team work.<br><br>

      <div class="container">
          <h2 class="titles">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you 
          have just used that time ti practise proggraming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>

          <p class="main-text">I did feel that at the begging of the course, because I did not understand why we were doing it.
          But with the pass of the days/weeks I got it, it become clear why we were doing it.<br><br>
