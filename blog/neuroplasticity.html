          <h2 class="titles">Discussing Neuroplasticity</h2>
          <p class="main-text">It is the process by which permanent learning takes place in you brain.
          When people repeatedly practise an activity or access a memory, their neural networks - groups of neurons that
          fire together, creating electrochemical pathways.<br>
          Otherwise when people stop practising new things, the brain  will eventually eliminate the conecting cells that formed
          the pathways.<br>
          Practice makes permanent. The more times the network is stimulated, the stronger and more efficient it becomes.
          We could think this as an analogy. Let's think in a motorway. 
          If we do not have trafic, there is no sense to keep it working or open, we could shut it down.
          In the other hand, if we have lots of trafic, we have to keep in good shape, making it stronger and safer, 
          to handle that amount of trafic.<br>
          It is proven  that neuroplasticity helps people to create new ways of functioning and behavior(autism, ADD, depression,
          etc.)<br><br>
        
          I think we could take advantage of the neuroplasticity if we understand how the brain works. The brain can change is 
          three basic ways to support learning.<br>
          One of this is chemical change. Basically the brain function by  transfering chemical signal between neurons and this
          trigger a series of actions and reactions. This change can happen rapidly. This support short-term memory and short-term
          improvement in the performance of a motor skill.<br>
          The second one is altering its structure. While we are learning our brain is changing the connections bvetween neurons.
          This process takes a bit more time. That is way it is related with long-term memory and long-term improvement in a motor
          skill.<br>
          The last one, but not less important it is altering its function. As we use a brain section its become more and more
          excitable and easy to use it again.  And as your brain has these areas that increase their excitability, the brain 
          shifts how and when they are activated.
          With learning, we see that whole networks of brain activity are shifting and changing.<br>
        
          Having this concept in mind, we could use this practices to improve our learning journey.
          We could practice a little bit everyday an activity to make our "neural pathways" stronger. <br><br></p>

          <h2 class="titles">Let's talk about Growth Mindset</h2>
          <p class="main-text">There are two types of mindset we could cultivate. The Growth Mindset is that embraces problems 
          as opportunities to learn. This people believe that new abilities can be developed through practice.<br>
          The Fixed Mindset is the one that avoids problems, often because of fear to fail, is the Fixed Mindset. 
          They believe the basic qualities like intelligence or talents are fixed traits and this traits are responsible for
          success.<br>
          Knowing this is very relevant, because we could think in our mindset and try to adjusted or evolve it.<br> 
          This research surpriced me, because I was able to visualized the way to train the growth mindset. <br>
          I think a good way to integrate this concept is just enjoy the learnig journey and praise process other than result.<br></p>

          <p class="main-text">I think during this learning journey I am adopting new habits, and because of that I am seing progress in my 
          "knolegde". Sometimes thinking in the Mindset can help you to choose a path to follow. 
          Trying to give attention to the learning process and praise it.</p>
