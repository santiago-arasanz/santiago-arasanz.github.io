        <h2 class="titles">Differences between HTML and CSS:</h2>

        <p class="main-text">I could do an analogy with this if we take as exmple a car crashed. I would say that HTML could be the guy in charge of check the car's structure and parts.
        No parts can be missing, you need the frame, doors, roof, tyres, etc.
        After the body structure's check, if there is nothing missing, the guy in charge of the paint starts to work in the car. That guy is going to be the CSS. Who is going to be in 
        charge to "make" pretty our "website/car". Playing with colors, font's type, moving texts around...</p><br><br>
      
        <h2 class="titles">Control Flow and loops</h2>
      
        <p class="main-text">I would try to explaine control flow and loops within a daily activity.
        Let's imagine ourselves going to the grocery store.
        During a normal day we will drive there , buy stuffs, pay and then we go home. Done! We completed the task/activity.
        But what can happen if we are at the queue to pay and we realised that we forgot the wallet? 
        This is when Control Flow and loops appear. We have to leave the groseries there, go home to pick up the wallet, come back to the grocery store, pay and go home.
        The loop could be the entire process to get food, clothes,etc. We are going to do that maybe a couple times in a month, but if something happens, we have to modify or stop
        that process, taking further actions.</p><br><br>
      
        <h2 class="titles">DOM? What is that?</h2>
      
        <p class="main-text">DOM means Document Object Model. Basically It represent the web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and their components as nodes and objects. 
        Because of that, programming languages can interarct with the page.
        We could thing as analogy in a tree of objects.</p><br><br>

        <h2 class="titles">Difference between accesing data form arrays and objects</h2>
      
        <p class="main-text">The first step to understand the difference between them is undestant their structure.
        An array is a data structure that we use to represent a  list of  items.
        The way to access to this data is through the index. The index is going to return the data stored in that array's position. After that, we can work with it, assing it to a 
        variable, or do whatever we want.
      
        In the other hand, an object can be represented with common object...like a car.
        A car has properties associated with it, as color, size, weight ,type. Those properties are going to define the car.
        We could call those properties "key", and each "key" as a value associated with it.
        They way to access an object's data is trought the "squeare bracket" or "dot" notation.
        As we mention in array's explanation, we could assign the object's data to a variable and work with it.</p><br><br>
      
      
        <h2 class="titles">Function</h2>

      
        <p class="main-text">A function is a set of statements that performs a particular task. We could say that it is a block of code that does something.
        Functions are very useful, because if we have to do the same task  in different ocassions, we do not need to write the code "X" times, we just have to "call" the function
        to do It work.</p>
