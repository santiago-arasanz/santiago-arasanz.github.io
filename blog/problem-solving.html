          <title>Problems? Problem-solving Techniques?</title>

          <p class="main-text">This week was a <span class="unknown-word"> challenge</span>. The 80% of the content was new for me,
          and I needed time to <span class="unknown-word"> digest it.</span>.<br>
          I really like the logic behind the problems and I like to interact in it, but sometimes it is difficult when you do not 
          understand the <span class="unknown-word">mechanic of it</span>.<br>
          I found myself stuck a couple of times, more that I wanted. I normally draw in a piece of paper the problem and how I would like to resolve it.
          Sometimes, I have to add or move some <span class="unknown-word"> little boxes</span> from my solution, but normally it is ok.<br>
          I believe that using <span class="unknown-word">pseudo-code</span> is very important for me. I do not have a <span class="unknown-word">Rubber duck</span>,
          but I found it very useful, I tried to talk with imaginary rubber duck and it did work, I was surpriced about that.
          I did use a lot Google and Youtube as well. I found like I withhold more data/infromation when I see videos than reading pages, at least during last week.
          It was very helpul asking for help in Discord channel. Sometimes when I am very involved in a task I can not see small details.
          If I have to be honest, I think the last option I would take is asking to coaches. I think that it is something that I have to work on. 
          Maybe it's related to the fact that I'm stubborn...<br><br>

          I think the most important think that I learned during this process is that you could save time and learn a lot when you interact or exchange
          ideas with peers or coaches.

          <title>am I confident with problem-solving techniques?</title>

          <p class="main-text"> As I mentioned before, I am always using <span class="unknown-word"> pseudo-code</span>, I find it very useful
          because I do not like to work with abstract things, then using this method I could visualize in a piece of paper <span class="unknown-word"> the problem</span>.<br>
          I think when I want to use this method called <span class="unknown-word"> Trying something</span>, I am using it at the same time with
          <span class="unknown-word"> Console log</span>. If I want to now if the code enters in a function or loop, I am just console.loggin messages.<br>
          Unfortunally I found a couple times a bit tricky to read the <span class="unknown-word"> Error Messages </span>. It did help me,
          but sometimes I found that the error message was not related with my actual error.<br>

          <title>Reflecting a bit...</title>

          <p class="main-text">After reading all the methods, I think that I have to ask or share more ideas with peers or coaches.
          Maybe that is the technique that I am feeling less confortable or confident. Reflecting about this will help me to improve
          my learning path.<br><br>
