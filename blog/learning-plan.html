      <p class="main-text">My goal in a short time is to finish the course in DevAcademy. Get all the knowledge required to get a job in the industry.
        I do not have a timeframe for this, but I know it is going to take me a few months.
        I guess my next step would be to get a job and earn experience on it, maybe for 1 or 2 years.
        Here we go with my long-term career goal. It is to have my project, maybe we could call it business.
        
        Like I said before. I think and I am feeling that my language is my main limitation. Sometimes I am struggling for a while trying to find the correct expression or word. I know that the knowledge comes with time, then I am not worried about it.
        I do not know if this qualified as a strength, but I have very clear what I want in my life, my goal, then I will not rest until getting there. Maybe that means I am a persistent person.
        
        I would like to develop my communication skill. Because I think that is my main limitation. Sometimes if you want to explain something to a person who has not that knowledge, you have to explain your ideas very well, for me, this is very hard. I know this is not related to DevAcademy, but in Its way is helping me a bit.
        
        Talking about myself I am using a kind of Pomodoro technique. Resting a bit between a study session. For me, it is a huge improvement, because I have not used this technique in my all life.
        Then I found it very helpful to have those mini-breaks, just to disconnect my brain and recharge energy.
        I already saw some changes in my mindset.
        I think the main key to working productively with a group of people is communication. If you have that is great, then you can have feedback from teammates or facilitators. This is going to make rich your and your teammates's work experience. We could apply this in your personal life as well...How many problems or issues could we have avoided by having good communication?
        
        If things get ugly I will take it easy, think about it for a few minutes, reflect and if I cannot get any result of it, I will ask for help, a facilitator, teamwork, etc.
        We have lots of ways to ask for help. I could reach my facilitator via e-mail, discord.
        If I cannot get in touch with them I guess I will use all my resources to try to fix the issue.
        
        
        
        I guess I will expect help from the facilitation team. I am not talking about technical help right now, maybe I would expect that they show me the path in my learning trip. Sometimes small tips could be very helpful to avoid mistakes, especially during this course, because the content is huge and we have just 16 weeks to digest it.
        "be careful not to get lost down too deep in the rabbit holes! "
        
        Talking about schedules. I am practically free of commitments. I took these weeks just to do the course and be focused on that. Of course, I have some things to do like make lunch or dinner when I am with my family, but It won't be a problem. Anyway, I would like to keep the workload during the week, rest during the weekend and spend time with the family.</p>
