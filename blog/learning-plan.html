      <h2 class="titles"> Random thoughts </h2>
      <p class="main-text"> My goal in a short time is to finish the course in DevAcademy. Get all the knowledge required to get a job in the industry.
        I do not have a timeframe for this, but I know it is going to take me a few months.
        I guess my next step would be to get a job and earn experience on it, maybe for 1 or 2 years.
        Here we go with my long-term career goal. It is to have my project, maybe we could call it business.<br><br>
        
        Like I said before. I think and I am feeling that my limitation is my language. Sometimes I am struggling for a while trying to find the correct expression or word. 
        I know that the knowledge comes with time, then I am not worried about it.<br><br>

        I do not know if this qualified as a strength, but I have very clear what I want in my life, my goal, then I will not rest until getting there. Maybe that means I am a persistent person.
        
        I would like to develop my communication skill. Because I think that is my main limitation. Sometimes if you want to explain something to a person who has not that knowledge, 
        you have to explain your ideas very well, for me, this is very hard. I know this is not related to DevAcademy, but in Its way is helping me a bit.<br><br>
        
        Talking about myself I am using a kind of Pomodoro technique. Resting a bit between study session. For me, it is a huge improvement, because I have not used this technique in my all life.
        Then I found it very helpful to have those mini-breaks, just to disconnect my brain and recharge energy.
        I already saw some changes in my mindset.<br><br>

        I think the main key to working productively with a group of people is communication. If you have that is great, then you can have feedback from teammates or facilitators.
        This is going to make rich your and your teammates's work experience. We could apply this in your personal life as well...How many problems or issues could we have avoided by having good communication?<br><br>
        
        If things get ugly I will take it easy, think about it for a few minutes, reflect and if I cannot get any positive result, I will ask for help, a facilitator, teamwork, etc.
        We have lots of ways to ask for help. I could reach my facilitator via e-mail, discord.
        If I cannot get in touch with them I guess I will use all my resources to try to fix the issue.<br><br>     
        
        I guess I will expect help from the facilitation team. I am not talking about technical help right now, maybe I would expect that they show me the path in my learning trip. Sometimes small tips could be 
        very helpful to avoid mistakes, especially during this course, because the content is huge and we have just 16 weeks to digest it.<br><br>
        <span class="unknown-word">"Be careful not to get lost down too deep in the rabbit holes!"</span>.<br><br>
        
        Talking about schedules. I am practically free of commitments. I took these weeks just to do the course and be focused on that. Of course, I have things to do at home,
        but It won't be a problem. Anyway, I would like to keep the workload during the week, rest during the weekend and spend time with the family.<br><br>

      <h2 class="titles"> Learning Plan Bootcamp </h2>
      <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p class="main-text">I think my long term goal it did not change, it will be the same. Probably it is going to be delayed a bit because I know now that I need to know 
        a lots of things, it looks like a endless learning journey.
        I do not have a destination on mind, I will be happy if I find a job after bootcamp.<br><br>
      </p>

      <h3>What do you think your biggest strenghts and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
      <p class="main-text">I think my limitation will be the same, my language. I am working on it, I think I am getting better, but it could be my limitation.
        Strengths... I could say the same, I am persistent and I like challenges.<br<br>
      </p>

      <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
      <p class="main-text">I think it will be finish the tasks on time. Sometimes when I get stuck, it is hard to move from that state, and it takes me a lot of 
        time to resolve that.<br><br>
      </p>

      <h3>What non-technical skills-human skils- would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      <p class="main-text">I think I would like to improve my teamwork skills. I like to work with people, but sometimes it is hard to deal with a group.
        Everybody think different, have different ideas. I guess I would like to learn how to intregate all those ideas, all the people, keep a good working enviroment.<br><br>
      </p>

      <h3>What are you expentations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
      <p class="main-text">I would expect help from the team. This is a key point. I have no experience with the NZ educational system, but from where I come from, the system is totally different.
        I kind of like the flipped classroom, but I do not find it helpful sometimes. I found myself watching videos, or reading websites for hours, learning stuff. But, everybody can post in a website,
        sometimes you get wrong answers and you learn from them. Basically , I think sometimes we need to be more followed.<br><br>
      </p>

      <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
      <p class="main-text">I am totally full time in this course, then all my energy and focus is in this. I left my job to do it and I am trying to do my best. Sometimes it is not enough but I am trying.
        I am trying to keep the workload during the week, I do not mind to be at the computer 10 or 12 hours a day. But I consider that the weekend is the time to enjoy family, friends, activities...<br><br>
